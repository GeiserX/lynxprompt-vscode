# LynxPrompt for VS Code

Manage AI IDE configuration files across 30+ AI coding tools directly from VS Code.

LynxPrompt helps you create, sync, and manage configuration files for Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and many more AI coding assistants -- all from a single platform.

## Features

### Sidebar Tree View

Browse your LynxPrompt blueprints and local AI config files in a dedicated sidebar panel.

- **My Blueprints**: View all your cloud blueprints, grouped by type (CLAUDE_MD, CURSOR_RULES, etc.)
- **Local Config Files**: Auto-detects AI configuration files in your workspace with sync status indicators

<!-- Screenshot: sidebar tree view showing blueprints grouped by type and local files with status icons -->

### Authentication

Sign in to LynxPrompt using the secure device flow -- no need to paste tokens manually.

1. Run **LynxPrompt: Sign In** from the command palette
2. A browser window opens for you to authenticate
3. The extension automatically receives your token

### Pull Blueprints

Download blueprints from LynxPrompt to your workspace with a single click. The extension automatically places files in the correct location based on blueprint type.

- CLAUDE_MD blueprints go to `CLAUDE.md`
- CURSOR_RULES blueprints go to `.cursor/rules/`
- COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS go to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- And more...

### Push Local Configs

Right-click any AI config file to push it to LynxPrompt as a blueprint. The extension auto-detects the blueprint type from the filename.

### Diff and Sync

Compare local files against their cloud counterparts using the VS Code diff editor. Sync changes in either direction with a single click.

### Generate Config

Open the LynxPrompt wizard in your browser to generate new AI configuration files with an interactive step-by-step process.

### Convert Between Formats

Convert AI configuration files between different formats locally (e.g., CLAUDE_MD to CURSOR_RULES content structure).

### File Watchers

The extension monitors linked AI config files for changes and notifies you when local files diverge from their cloud versions.
